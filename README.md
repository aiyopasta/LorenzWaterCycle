"WaterCycleTest.py" is the main file with the waterwheel animations.

The reason this is public is so others might take inspiration from my work and possibly learn from it. Please do NOT blatantly copy it and render out the animation to post on your own social media, or I'll stop making these codes public, and throw a banana at you.
That being said, the animation on Wikipedia for the Malkus Waterwheel page is indeed mine, and as it is part of Wikimedia Commons, you can do with that animation whatever you like.
